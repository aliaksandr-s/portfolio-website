**Hash Clear** is a crypto-currency exchange platform.

Here I worked on a front-end part of the project which included **Administration panel** and **Client app**. I had to implement everyting from scratch using provided mockups working closely with a back-end developer.

**My main responsibilities were:**
* Choosing a technology stack and creating starting boilerplates
* Creating a layout based on application mockups
* Mentoring a small team and assuring code quality by daily code reviews

**Technology stack:** React, Redux, redux-saga, redux-first-router, axios, styled-components, Semantic UI.
