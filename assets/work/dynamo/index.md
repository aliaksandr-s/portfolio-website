[Dynamo](https://dynamo.co.uk) is free online mortgage adviser. 
I worked on front-end of **Customer Portal** and **Middle Office** parts of the product.
I was a part of a hightly motivated distributed team, people were located in **London**, **Belgrade** and **Minsk**. I did my best to provide **the best code quality** and **good-looking UI**.

**My main responsibilities were:**
* Creating new highly reusable front-end components
* Mobile first and responsive styling using BEM methodology
* Implementing front-end logic and api integration
* Covering projects with unit tests, trying to achieve 100% coverage

**Technology stack:** React, Redux, redux-saga, redux-little-router, TypeScript, Jest, BEM.
