				<p><strong>Like many people, I want to enjoy my work.</strong> I want to feel like I'm having a positive impact on the lives of the customers and make their lives easier, better and happier. I'm interested in roles where I'm allowed — nay, encouraged — to keep my hands and eyes on a product every step of the way. Where I can manage and build a project without having to spend all day in meetings and provide the best possible experience for the customers.</p>
